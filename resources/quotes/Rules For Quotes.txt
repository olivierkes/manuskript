We'd be glad to get more quotes! However there are a few rules.

Rules for quotes:
1. They must be clean. If you have to edit them so they're clean that's fine. 
2. They must pertain to writing. That doesn't just mean they are from authors but that they are useful/funny/insightful in a way that would encourage or at least make a writer think.
3. Follow the format please. Tab first than an opening quote and closing quote followed by the source.

If you have a question just open an issue.
