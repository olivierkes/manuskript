	"Don't say it was “delightful”; make us say “delightful” when we’ve read the description. You see all those words (horrifying, wonderful, hideous, exquisite) are only like saying to your readers, “Please will you give my job for me?”" -- C.S. Lewis 
	"Don’t use words too big for the subject. Don’t say “infinitely” when you mean “very”; otherwise you’ll have no word left when you want to talk about something really infinite" -– C.S. Lewis
	“I’m not in a mood for writing; I must write on until I am.” -- Jane Austen
	"Show Don't Tell" -- Pretty much everyone
